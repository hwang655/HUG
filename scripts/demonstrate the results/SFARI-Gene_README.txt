Here is the information of this dataset, copied from their website (2.5   Human Gene Entry Summary)


	Each gene in the Human Gene module has a dedicated entry summary page that contains the following information:

	Gene Score – This section shows the assigned gene score category that assesses the evidence linking it to ASD. The scoring criteria can be found here.

	Autism Reports/Total Reports – This section details the number of ASD-specific reports that implicate a gene compared to the total number of relevant non-ASD-specific reports that mention the gene.

	Rare Variants/Common Variants – This section denotes whether the variant identified is rare or common.
	Aliases – This section lists any alternative names for the gene.

	Associated Syndromes – Many ASD-linked genes are also found in patients with other syndromes. This section lists associated syndromes that also exhibit a particular gene, if any.

	Genetic Category – This section denotes which of the four genetic categories a gene falls under.

	Chromosome Band – This section lists the chromosomal band in which a gene is found.

	Associated Disorders – Similar to the Associated Syndromes section, any disorders in which an ASD-linked gene is found are listed here.

	Relevance to Autism – This section summarizes the scientific report information that connects the gene to ASD.

	Molecular Function – This section describes the molecular details of the gene and protein.

	External Links – This section provides links to major external databases such as Entrez Gene, UniProt, and GeneCards.


Here is the informtaion about scoring

The syndromic category includes mutations that are associated with a substantial degree of increased risk and consistently linked to additional characteristics not required for an ASD diagnosis. If there is independent evidence implicating a gene in idiopathic ASD, it will be listed as “#S” (e.g., 2S, 3S). If there is no such independent evidence, the gene will be listed simply as “S”.


CATEGORY 1
(High Confidence)
Genes in this category are all found on the SPARK gene list, or on the list of genes reported by Satterstrom et al., Cell 180, 1-17 (2020). Each of these genes has been clearly implicated in ASD—typically by the presence of at least three de novo likely-gene-disrupting mutations being reported in the literature—and such mutations identified in the sequencing of the SPARK cohort are typically returned to the participants. Some of these gene meet the most rigorous threshold of genome-wide significance; all at least meet a threshold false discovery rate of < 0.1

CATEGORY 2
(Strong Candidate)
Genes with two reported de novo likely-gene-disrupting mutations.
A gene uniquely implicated by a genome-wide association study, either reaching genome-wide significance or, if not, consistently replicated and accompanied by evidence that the risk variant has a functional effect.

CATEGORY 3
(Suggestive Evidence)
Genes with a single reported de novo likely-gene-disrupting mutation.
Evidence from a significant but unreplicated association study, or a series of rare inherited mutations for which there is not a rigorous statistical comparison with controls.
